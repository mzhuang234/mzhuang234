- 👋 Hi, I’m Michelle Zhuang.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about programming, and finding out how GitHub works.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning math at Point Loma Nazarene University.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that interests me / I am capable of, as I don't know this place that well yet.
- 📫 How to reach me ... mzhuang234@hotmail.com
